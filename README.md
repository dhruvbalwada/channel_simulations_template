# channel_simulations_template
Template for wind/temperature forced channel simulations in MITgcm

The template was created by using a combination of gyre and ginsburg. This is because it was easy at that time to run notebooks on gyre to create the input files. Also because some of the data used to create the initial temp field was available only on gyre.
